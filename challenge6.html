        JavaScript code to create a tip calculator for a
        restaurant. The rules for tip are that if the bill amount is
        less than 250 , tip is 20%, if the bill is between 250 and
        500 then tip is 15% and when the bill is above 500 then
        tip is 10%. Your code should accept four bill amounts
        from the user , calculate their tips and print the original
        bill as well as final bill for each amoun
